# kobeni

*cutest web framework*

Kobeni is cute, super lightweight, easy to use JavaScript framework designed to provide essential functionalities for building web applications. **Minified version of kobeni ~ 1KB**. Kobeni offers powerful features such as **routing, state, and component management**.

*(documentation will be available soon).*
*(code in index.js is mostly self-explanatory if you are a good at javascript).*

Kobeni is released under the MIT License. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more information.

### Note
*I think kobeni should be a compiler rather than index.min.js shipped and changing stuff.*
